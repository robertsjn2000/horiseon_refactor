            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

<!-- GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title -->

<!-- First additions were sementic tags in place of the generic div tags. With the addition of the nav tag in place of the div tag in the header, I had to check in css that div was no longer being targeted. -->

<!-- Second additions were alt tags with all photos to make them more accessible -->

<!-- Added an id so that the search engine optomization link functions correctly. -->

<!-- updated the copywrite year at the bottom of the page -->
